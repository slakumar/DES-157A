                <p>When reading the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><strong>Best practices for form design</strong></a>, by Salim Ansari, I was struck by how many of the usability features that I took for granted had intentional thought and user psychology backing them up. Many of the features may seem insignificant in terms of overall impact on user retention while completing forms, but they actually make a big difference in how people interact with these sites.</p>

                <p>Two such features reminded me of my own experiences while filling out webforms, namely tips #3 (<em>“Multiple Steps”</em>) and #4 (<em>“Ask the Easy Questions First”</em>). I find that when a form has too many steps with what seems like no end in sight, I’m more inclined to abandon the form altogether. But when the form has a percentage completion bar at the top of the page, it feels like less of a cognitive load, even though I’m still following through with all the steps. Similarly, the credit card details example resonated with me, because there’s been many times when a form has asked me to fill out credit card details that I’d have to physically get up to retrieve, and my brain immediately tells me to give up. However, when I’m asked at the end of the form, I feel like “Okay, I’ve done 90% of the work, might as well finish off the last 10%.”</p>

                <p>I think a good example of a website form that I’ve interacted with that exemplifies such best practices is <a href="https://www.sephora.com/checkout/shipping">Sephora</a>, with the form part happening during the Checkout process. Fields are sized accordingly, labels are inline, but shift above the text as soon as the user starts typing, and the form itself is tab ready.</p>
