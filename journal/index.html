                <h3>Part One:</h3>

                <p>This image that I have chosen is interesting because upon first glance, viewers wouldn’t know that it’s my favorite candle. They especially wouldn’t know this because from the front, it looks as if it hasn’t been used much, due to how the candle wax has melted and left behind a cast. Viewers also wouldn’t know that I use the candle most when I need to relax, destress, and generally unwind. They could guess this from its description of having lavender notes, but may be thrown off by the inclusion of espresso with that. This image is a key part of my collection of scented candles, and what it says about me relates directly to scent and more indirectly, to mood. By observing which candles I choose to buy and keep in my collection, different aspects of my personality and the moods that I experience and choose to cultivate for myself can be explored.</p>

                <h3>Part Two:</h3> 

                <p>This image seems to be about Meera’s experience at a concert, with the subject of the image being the artist performing. The image conveys a sense of motion, obviously taken while the artist was moving around the stage, and the colors of the background combined with the artist’s clothes gives it a dreamlike feeling. To me, the photo is interesting because I see the joyful expression on the performing artist’s face, and can almost hear the roar of the crowd cheering along. I can envision myself as part of that crowd and feel my heart racing with excitement. The most obvious parts of the image are that it’s at a concert, but the location of the concert, who the artist is, and where exactly Meera was in the crowd is left a mystery (the image seems to be zoomed in, so not necessarily in the front rows). The genre of music that the artist is performing is also left a mystery. I assume that her collection is about her favorite concert experiences.</p>

            <section>
                <p>After reading <em>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</em> by Michael Gonchar, I went on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a> and found <a href="https://www.igloo.inc/">Igloo Inc.,</a> a crypto company that’s the parent company of a popular NFT collection, Pudgy Pigeons. The article, which emphasizes the importance of reading closely into images and using context clues to figure out the big picture/find deeper meaning, got me thinking about this website that I found. It’s super cool, with features like scroll interactivity, and insane three-dimensional animations that had me mesmerized. So I decided to try and read deeper into the design choices made for the website.</p>

                <p>The first animation features an igloo with ice blocks that separate when the mouse is dragged over them, with thin lines connecting them. This could be alluding to the fact that this is a crypto company that works with BLOCK chain (get it?). As you scroll down, the company’s three portfolios are presented, each one encased in a 3-D animated block of ice, which is very on theme and definitely keeps up the cohesive brand image they have going on.</p> 
                
                <p>At the “end” of the page, you are taken through a series of ice rings to a futuristic footer section where their social media links are displayed as being made of something that looks like nano-bot technology that changes shape as you drag the mouse over each one. This breaks the theme of “ice” a little bit, but maybe it's supposed to be what lies inside the igloo, since it’s the footer of the page. I put “end” of the page in quotes because the site features infinite scroll, something that I love, because it increases the satisfaction factor for me.</p>

                <h2>Overlays Design Patterns Research</h2>

            <section>
                <p>My main takeaway from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"><strong>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes Overlays</strong></a>, by Katherine Whitenton is that using overlays in web design can be really effective when used with care. Overlays are pop-ups that demand the user's attention by covering the main content, making them great for delivering important information or requiring a quick action, like confirming a purchase or showing a critical alert. But because they interrupt the user experience, it’s best to use overlays sparingly and only for urgent or necessary messages.</p>

                <p>Overloading users with too many overlays—or using them for non-essential purposes—can become frustrating. Frequent interruptions can disrupt the flow of navigation and make the overall experience feel cluttered. It can lead users to ignore them altogether or even abandon the site. In my opinion, they’re best used in situations that require immediate attention or interaction. That way, you can maintain a smooth user experience while still displaying critical information when needed.</p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <date>October 14, 2024</date>
            </header>

            <section>
                <p>When reading the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"><strong>Best practices for form design</strong></a>, by Salim Ansari, I was struck by how many of the usability features that I took for granted had intentional thought and user psychology backing them up. Many of the features may seem insignificant in terms of overall impact on user retention while completing forms, but they actually make a big difference in how people interact with these sites.</p>

                <p>Two such features reminded me of my own experiences while filling out webforms, namely tips #3 (<em>“Multiple Steps”</em>) and #4 (<em>“Ask the Easy Questions First”</em>). I find that when a form has too many steps with what seems like no end in sight, I’m more inclined to abandon the form altogether. But when the form has a percentage completion bar at the top of the page, it feels like less of a cognitive load, even though I’m still following through with all the steps. Similarly, the credit card details example resonated with me, because there’s been many times when a form has asked me to fill out credit card details that I’d have to physically get up to retrieve, and my brain immediately tells me to give up. However, when I’m asked at the end of the form, I feel like “Okay, I’ve done 90% of the work, might as well finish off the last 10%.”</p>

                <p>I think a good example of a website form that I’ve interacted with that exemplifies such best practices is <a href="https://www.sephora.com/checkout/shipping">Sephora</a>, with the form part happening during the Checkout process. Fields are sized accordingly, labels are inline, but shift above the text as soon as the user starts typing, and the form itself is tab ready.</p>
