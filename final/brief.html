                <p>For my final project, I plan on updating my “Every Picture Project” by combining it with the idea of “Game On!” I chose this topic because I like my concept of scented candles but I also like the idea of creating a game based around them. I think my focus will be on updating usability. I want to style the page after 8-bit style animation, with the idea consisting of a “candle battle” (sort of OG Mortal Kombat style), in which the candle that wins the Game of Pig will have its flame burn higher (shoot up in height). I may also want to incorporate scent illustrations from the candle that wins, but I’m not sure about this yet. I will do user testing with friends and maybe ask the TA for help with some of the code.
